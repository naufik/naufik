### Hello

My name is Naufal, I'm based in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Most of the projects you see here will either work in progress... I mean as long as writing them is still fun.

**Technical Interests**:

I am currently in the process of pulling my life together, so I'm not comitting to writing anything that's too serious. Right now the code I _do_ write revolves around:

- Work (duh)
- Learning Rust.
- Using Haskell to write things that take 70% faster in Javascript.
- Avoiding type-unsafe languages.
- IoT, home automation, and other kinds of automations.
- DevOpsy stuff - and keeping my Minecraft server alive.
- Reading through 'Modern Operating Systems' by Herbert Bos.

**Affiliations**:

- [InGenious AI, Pty. Ltd.](https://ingenious.ai). Full Stack Engineer. Current.
- [University of Melbourne](https://unimelb.edu.au). Tutor and Demonstrator (2018 - 2020). Research Assistant (Jul - Dec 2019)

_Disclaimer: this page is also, work in progress._
