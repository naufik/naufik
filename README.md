# Hello, I'm Naufal. 

I am a software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia. I came from Indonesia.

Most of the repositories are work-in-progress or straight up 'temporarily abandoned' (i.e. awaiting motivation or just time to continue). My life is currently focused on work, migrating, and creating a supportive environment for my loved ones in these trying times. Feel absolutely free to ask questions about any of my projects, but I can't promise to be committed to any projects. 


**Technical Interests**:

I don't write side projects as often now due to life commitments. However, the side projects I do write usually revolves around: 

- Learning Rust, the language. 
- Writing projects in Haskell to understand functional programing concepts. 
- Small home automation projects. 
- DevOps related stuff - such as keeping my Minecraft server alive.
- Learning linux internals, including the classic [ricing my window manager](https://github.com/naufik/.awesome), contributing to random GitHub repos and reading through 'Modern Operating Systems' by Herbert Bos.
